# Kickstarter Fundraising Prediction
## Problem Identification
Firstly, we want to identify what factors on the Kickstarter website presentation will influence the success of project.
Secondly, we want to build a model to predict whether a certain project will succeed or fail. 
Finally, we would like to discuss how fund raisers can increase their fund raised by modifying these attributes.

## Getting Data
We used Kaggle dataset as our main source: https://www.kaggle.com/parienza/kickstarter.
Additionally, we crawled additional information as needed from Kickstarter website using Beautiful Soup.

## Modeling
1. Logistic Regression
2. Trees
3. Linear Regression

# Analysis
Most important features that determine the success of a crowdfunding project:
1. Number of updates of recent production process and new designs during the crowfunding process
2. The rationality of target fundraising amount
3. Number of comments
4. Average rewards promise for a successful crowdfunding
5. Duration of the crowdfunding period
